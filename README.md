# pascal-OLS-modeling
draft regression for polynomials using pascal's triangle and OLS for coefficients.


this fun little nothing has a file for generating data and a file to do polynomial regression on that data. it's messy but it works up to 26 input variables... although it will chew up your RAM. consider adding swap.
